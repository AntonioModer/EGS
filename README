**Forwarning: This library was written 4 years ago, and some of the code is a bit hacky in places. Additionally, it hasn't been updated since (Only republished on my new GitHub account) so I would be surprised if it still worked in modern versions of Love2D.**

This is a GUI library for Love2D. It's very customizable and has literally tens of features.

It has a full-fledged event system (Similar to the one found at http://roblox.com) (Object.Event:connect(function))

It's realy easy to use! Here's a basic example:


require("Class.lua")
require("GUIElements\/GUIMain.lua")

function love.load()
	Button:new("ClickButton")
	ClickButton.text = "Move mouse on me and I will move to the left!"
	ClickButton:adjustSizeToText()
	--This changes it's size to the text's size, but also gives 2.5 pixels padding on all sides.
	ClickButton.position = {100, 100}
	--Position at x: 100, y: 100
	ClickButton.hasCaption = true
	--This makes the caption display a few seconds into hovering mouse on GUI (Second count adjustable!)
	ClickButton.caption = "Don't be shy! Move your mouse until I disapear!"
	--Sets the hover caption.
	ClickButton.mouseMoved:connect(function(x,y)
		--x and y are passed as arguments in most mouse events. We won't use them this time.
		ClickButton.position[1] = ClickButton.position[1] - 1
	end)
end

function love.draw()
	GUIDraw()
end

function love.update()
	GUIUpdate()
end


And that's a functional button that when you move your mouse on it, it moves away to the left! Simple, and easy!
It looks longer than it is because of all the comments, though.
